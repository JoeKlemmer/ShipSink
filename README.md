# ShipSink #

_ShipSink_ is similar to Battle Ship.

The object of the game is to sink the ship.  There will be one ship on
the grid.  The player will choose horizontal and vertical coordinates
and the game will calculate whether those coordinates were a hit or a
miss.  An "X" will mark a hit and "*" a miss.  The default levels are
set as so;

        Easy will be a grid of 10 by 10
        Normal will be a grid of 15 by 15
        Hard will be a grid of 20 by 20

This is configurable by changing the values in the file "GameData.txt".

To install this game simply unarchive it in a directory and run the
program.  There are two versions of the game; 'ShipSink' for Linux and
'ShipSink.exe' for MS Windows.  The game runs from the command line in
an X Term or DOS Window respectively.

The C++ source code is included and being released to the Public Domain.

It should compile without modifications on both Linux and Windows
